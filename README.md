Hello everyone! I'm here to communicate that I'm discontinuing the Alien CRT UI module. I'm not a programmer, so I do not have the knowledge or time to reverse engineer what makes sheets stop working with news updates on the main system. I learned a lot from this experience, and feel that a lot of people like the module, which makes me proud of how far I got with it since I started it with almost no knowledge of how these things work. I'm pulling the plug on foundry's listing for the module, but the github page will still be there if someone with more patience and experience whats to fork it. consider it and the art I made for it public domain. thanks for the support!
